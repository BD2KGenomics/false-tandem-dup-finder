# falseTandemDupFinder
+ Many genome assemblies contain scaffold gaps with two highly identical regions on each side
+ Instead of being tandem duplications, These two regions are likely to represent the same region
+ This false tandem duplication is possibly produced as a result of gap-filling algorithms, 
+ TODO: Script will correct the non-duplication using BLAT and can be run in parallel on a cluster using
  jobtree
